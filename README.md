Google Keep is an Android app I worked on during my second year second semester of my B.Sc. degree.
There are several applications that may be used to take notes and serve as reminders for appointments. 
One of the most popular applications is Google Keep. Google Keep is a great app for keeping track of notes.
However, there are certain issues with Google Keep, such as the lack of any reminders. 
As a result, we attempted to clone Google Keep and include functionality that are presently unavailable on the official app, 
making it a better and more trustworthy software.
